# ChatworkAPI
## The chatwork messaging API
Here, I have collected all of the api from chatwork. You can easily use the API on your own.

First of all,
Before start using the API, you need to know chatwork API authorization flow.

## Basic Auth Flow
You can easily use the api token get from here -> https://www.chatwork.com/service/packages/chatwork/subpackages/api/token.php
and authorized the request by providing it as a x-chatworktoken header on all requests.

## OAuth Flow
The OAuth flows (authorization grant) is also supported. For more information see here -> https://developer.chatwork.com/docs/oauth

## For Realtime notification
you might see the webhooks provided by chatwork. For more information -> https://developer.chatwork.com/docs/webhook

Hope this help you will.
Thank you.
