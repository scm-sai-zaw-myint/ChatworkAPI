# ChatworkAPI 

## The chatwork messaging API
Here, I have collected all of the api from chatwork. You can easily use the API on your own.

## Basic Auth Flow

First of all,
Before start using the API, you need to know chatwork API authorization flow.

You can easily use the api token get from here 
-> https://www.chatwork.com/service/packages/chatwork/subpackages/api/token.php
and authorized the request by providing it as a x-chatworktoken header on all requests. 
_Note the api token is never expired and be secured to use it._

## OAuth Flow
The OAuth flows (authorization grant) is also supported. For more information see here 
-> https://developer.chatwork.com/docs/oauth

## For Event/Realtime notification
You might see the webhooks provided by chatwork. For more information 
-> https://developer.chatwork.com/docs/webhook

## How to use
Import the json file under the Postman Collections folder to your postman.
